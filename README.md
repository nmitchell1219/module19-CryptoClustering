# Unsupervised Learning Challenge

This project analyzes cryptocurrency market data using K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We standardize the data, find the best number of clusters, and group the cryptocurrencies. The analysis is done twice: once using the original data and again after reducing the data's complexity with PCA. This approach helps simplify the data and improve the clustering process.
